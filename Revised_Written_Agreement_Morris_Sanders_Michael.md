Name: Michael Morris Sanders

# What Is Being Done?

One of my specific tasks is to act as a scribe and collect/write out anything learned while working as a site designer.  I will take input from the other group members as well.  This will be something given throughout the time spent on this.  I will also work with the other five on finish setting up the template used for the site, the pages, and assist the developers with plug-ins.  We will also take the pages written by the editors and put them onto the site.  The pages we all work on will be designed to look similar.  For now, we will be working as one group (the site designers and web developers).  I will acquire any information that will benefit the construction of this guidebook and show it to the other site designers.

# When Is It Being Done?

The collection of information acquired through working as a site designer will be given during the week before last to be checked by the editors and revised.  The pages have been set up for every chapter by the site designers.  We are waiting on editors the finish the chapters so we can modify them and add them to the site.  In the meantime we are working with the developers on the site
on the sites appearance and plug-ins. We have a PDF converter plug-in. Each month, a document will be compiled with information that may benefit the guidebook when it comes to site designer. We will acquire the different chapters and pages made by the editors and add them to the guidebook site.  This will be done each week with whatever they have to give.

# How Will It Be Evaluated?

Since in the gradebook the colleague evaluation is worth 8 points, I think that the work should assessed by splitting the work I will do into four specific sections worth 2 points.  The first two points will be based on how long it takes to fulfill everything. One point will be for completing all that is needed. The second point will be given for finishing everything within the time restraints I described above and ones developed later. Another two points will be based on what I collect and give to the editors as information learned about CMS while working as a site designer. The second point is given for writing, and another point is given for having information that is beneficial to the guidebook.  Another two points are given for accomplishing site design specific tasks described above. Two points are given to specific tasks carried out when assisting developers.  Anything done for this project will be compiled at the end and given to the evaluator.

# Who Will Evaluate It?

Nathan will be evaluating my progress/work for this assignment. They would be the optimal choice for evaluating my work.  They are both capable of seeing my progress from an outside perspective on my progress in the site designer group since we are in separate groups, and they can see how my work affects theirs in their group since the work I do connects to theirs.  I will be giving information I have collected over time through this project about things I feel should be added to the CMS book.  Since they are in the editor group, they will see the things I have compiled and have an understanding of what I have done.

# What has changed? 

Most things will remain unchanged. I changed the number of people working on our specific tasks to five because I miscounted.  We also are focusing on placing information giving by the editors and making pages on the website with a level on consistency. It works well with how we have been doing things.  Many things have been learned so far as to how these tasks will be accomplished and this will be icorporated into the final guide. I am working with an editor since I will be doing work similar to what they are doing in some ways.  A new addition is record of tasks kept in a word document that the leader of our group has been using.  It shows what we need to do and if we complete it.  That can be used to assist in the grading process.  Other things have been made more certain and changed.  Pages have been made and we are mostly waiting on the editors to finish their part when it comes to posting content.  Our current objective is to work with the site as it is now, and we are working to make the content look more orderly and similar looking to other chapters.
