Name: Nathan Morris

## What is being done?
As a developer, our tasks are to pick relevant plugins and implement them. After combining with the site designers group, I was no longer the leader of the group. This was taken up by Jason. In his communicating with other group leaders and admins, he will delegate tasks. In the blending of tasks with site designers, I will likely also take part in creating pages and structuring the website. 

## When is it being done?
The final due date of everything is at the end of the semester. Due dates will be established and communicated from the admins, to Jason, to group members. As the editors finish chapters on Google Docs, they will be formatted and posted by our group. This can only be done as the editors finisht their chapters.

## How will it be evaluated?
The work should be graded on whether it was done: <br>
**(1)** in a timely manner **[3 pts]**, <br>
**(2)** its quality **[2 pts]**, and <br>
**(3)** the fact that I was participating **[3 pts]**

## Who will evaluate it?
Michael will be evaluating me. He is in my group and therefore a good choice in that he will witness my work.

## What has changed?
The site designer and developer groups have been combined. Jason is the group leader, whereas I was leader when the groups were individual. Likewise, I will not be the one delegated tasks but receiving them.
