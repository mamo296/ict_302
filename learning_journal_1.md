<p>I did not learn too much this past week. I am already **somewhat** familiar with HTML, so Markdown is not entirely foreign to me. Albeit, I've never written anything in Markdown before this class. I'm already familiar with and have used many times:</p>
<ul>
<li>Linux</li>
<li>the terminal</li>
</ul>
