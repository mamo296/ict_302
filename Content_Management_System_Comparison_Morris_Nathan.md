## Similarities
(1) Google Analytics can be integrated into sites created with Hugo, WordPress, and Wix; however, Google has explicitly partnered with WordPress and therefore provides more apps for WordPress sites.<br>
(2) Hugo, WordPress, and Wix all have the same general purpose as a CMS, whereas something like GitHub is a CMS designed for specific content (code).
(3) All allow for HTML. I found WordPress made having HTML in a blog post a bit more confusing than Wix. WordPress obligates a separate page (the "code editor") for implementing HTML. Wix simply has the user press a button at the bottom of the blog post.

## Differences
(1) Wix seems to have a significantly simplified UI in comparison to WordPress or Hugo at face value.
(2) The dashboards of Wix and WordPress look very similar in layout.
(3) WordPress seems to have a more fleshed out reservoir of plugins or, at least, seems to have them more readily apparent.
