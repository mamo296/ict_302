### What Is Being Done?
(1) Communicate with admins and see to it that their directions are done by devs.
(2) Find suitable plugins and help with their implementation.

### When Is It Being Done?
I do not have a proper timeline of future commitments, but on ClickUp are tasks in the Dev folder which are to be completed in whole.

### How Will It Be Evaluated?
A developer's work has a clear cut standard: does it work? Thusly, plugins which I help to implement should work properly.

### Who Will Evaluate It?
Michael has agreed to review my work. He is suited as one of the site designers, with whom I will have contact moreso than other groups as a developer.
