# What Is Being Done?

The work that is being done so far that I have contributed to is as follows:
* Helping to locate a suitable PDF plugin for exporting the finalized website
* Implementing code block functionality
* Assist with editing the CSS files directly for style choices.
I am currently working on finding a way to customize the color of the codeblock without losing functionality.
# When Is It Being Done?

The first three points have already been done, and I am working on solutions currently for the last. I have found a slight work around using a plugin that will allow for having a more appealing code block, although the actual functions of the code will have to be shown outside. This may not be a problem, as that way each section of code displayed will be separate from one another, which may improve clarity.
# How Will It Be Evaluated?

If the plugin successfully exports the pdf version of the website correctly, and the code block functions as desired. For example, it should allow for displaying of code in addition with showing what that code actually does.
# Who Will Evaluate It?

Any developer or site designer that is familiar with what the other developers have been working on should be well suited to grade my contributions.
