# Learning Journal
## Nathan Morris<br>ICT302-001

<p>***Introduction:*** This is a written record of my learning in ICT 302, a class over *'content management systems'*.</p>

### 09/01/2019: Week 1
<p>I did not learn too much this past week. I am already **somewhat** familiar with HTML, so Markdown is not entirely foreign to me. Albeit, I've never written anything in Markdown before this class. I'm already familiar with and have used many times:</p>
<ul>
<li>Linux</li>
<li>the terminal</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, I'm already familiar with such things as GitHub. Some applications would be not in a Linux distribution's official repository, so I would run the "git" command within the terminal to download them.<br>I've never used Atom before. I normally write code in the terminal or a Python IDE, but have also used text editors such as Notepad++.</p>
<p>I think Atom is especially interesting in that it was developed by GitHub, so I look forward to getting more acquainted with it.</p>
