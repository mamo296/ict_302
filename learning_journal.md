# Learning Journal
## Nathan Morris<br>ICT302-001

***Introduction:*** This is a written record of my learning in ICT 302, a class over *'content management systems'*.

### 09/01/2019: Week 1
I did not learn too much this past week. I am already **somewhat** familiar with HTML, so Markdown is not entirely foreign to me. Albeit, I've never written anything in Markdown before this class. I'm already familiar with and have used many times:
<ul>
<li>Linux</li>
<li>the terminal</li>
</ul>
Thus, I'm already familiar with such things as GitHub. Some applications would be not in a Linux distribution's official repository, so I would run the "git" command within the terminal to download them.<br>I've never used Atom before. I normally write code in the terminal or a Python IDE, but have also used text editors such as Notepad++.</p>
<p>I think Atom is especially interesting in that it was developed by GitHub, so I look forward to getting more acquainted with it.

### 09/08/2019: Week 2
As I said above, I already have some experience with HTML -- *though it is not much.* So, I did not learn a terrible amount with this week's assignment. **However**, I have very, very little experience with CSS. I have done some stylizing from within tags, i.e.: &lt;h2>&lt;center>, etc. In my introductory webpage, I used the &lt;style> tag at the top of the HTML file, thus styling each subsequent tag used automatically. This, I had never done before.  

### 09/15/2019: Week 3
This week we defined *"content"*. *"Content"* is a word which is commonly used and understood, but not something you particularly think to define. For the purposes of this class, *"content"* is something that has __both__ undergone an editorial process __and__ produced for human conspumption. 
We also described the necessary positions in creating a CMS: administrators, developers, editors, stakeholders, and site designers. 

### 09/22/2019: Week 4
This week we outlined what the CMS guidebook would consist of, organized ourselves into groups of what we were most interested in (as far was roles in a CMS workflow are concerned), and what groups would be handling what. I chose to be in a developer role, becuase: (1) I am not much of a people person and (2) I have experience in writing code.

### 09/29/2019: Week 5
This week we elaborated on the concept of **"content"**. A **"channel"** is *"a distribution outlet for content; a method in which content is consumed."* **Content**, as opposed to **presentation**, is information. Whereas **"presentation"** concerns style, makes the content appear a specific, and is reusable. (I did not attend class Friday.)

### 10/20/2019: Week 8
This week we did a collaborative slideshow about different CMS's. My assigned CMS was MediaWiki. As someone who enjoys reading Wikipedia and has edited it, I found this interesting. There was also an assignment to compare Hugo, WordPress, and another CMS (which I chose Wix). In creating a Wix account in order to properly compare it, I may actually keep the account for documenting some of my learning/reading in blog format.

### 10/27/2019: Week 9
Alison
IAAP: International Assc. of Accessibility Professionals
alt text in html <a> tag is for the visually impaired 
On Wednesday, Oct. 23rd, Alsion came to talk to the class concerning the IAAP ("International Assc. of Accessibility Professionals"). This isn't something that I really knew about. One thing that I thought was interesting, which I did not know before, was the true purpose of the alt text within the &lt;img&gt; tag. I am not visually impaired, so this has never concerned me, but Alison played a video of a visually impaired man using the computer as he would normally, which read off the alt text for him to know what was on the screen.
