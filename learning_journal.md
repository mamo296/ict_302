# Learning Journal
## Nathan Morris<br>ICT302-001

***Introduction:*** This is a written record of my learning in ICT 302, a class over *'content management systems'*.

### 09/01/2019: Week 1
I did not learn too much this past week. I am already **somewhat** familiar with HTML, so Markdown is not entirely foreign to me. Albeit, I've never written anything in Markdown before this class. I'm already familiar with and have used many times:
<ul>
<li>Linux</li>
<li>the terminal</li>
</ul>
Thus, I'm already familiar with such things as GitHub. Some applications would be not in a Linux distribution's official repository, so I would run the "git" command within the terminal to download them.<br>I've never used Atom before. I normally write code in the terminal or a Python IDE, but have also used text editors such as Notepad++.</p>
<p>I think Atom is especially interesting in that it was developed by GitHub, so I look forward to getting more acquainted with it.

### 09/08/2019: Week 2
As I said above, I already have some experience with HTML -- *though it is not much.* So, I did not learn a terrible amount with this week's assignment. **However**, I have very, very little experience with CSS. I have done some stylizing from within tags, i.e.: <h2><center>, etc. In my introductory webpage, I used the <style> tag at the top of the HTML file, thus styling each subsequent tag used automatically. This, I had never done before.
